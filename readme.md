This app will help me plan my upcoming week using a weekly design system.

It's a combination of reflection and planning.

# Summary of the weekly design system

## 1. Connect to your vision

This will help you make decisions that are aligned with your goals.

- Write out your tombstone statement: write out how you want to be remembered in 4 paragraphs
- Write out your big 5: what are you 5 priorities in your life?
- Write out your top 5 values

You can edit these or just review them to keep your vision in mind.

The three step success formula:

Better daily awareness > Better daily choices > Better daily results

## 2. Weekly story

Reflection on the past week. This will help build awareness, accountability and celebration

Write a paragraph about each day of the week. Reflect on how you acted and think about the "wins" as well as your "opportunities to optimize".

Tip: write out a short summary at the end of each day that will help you remember what happened once you're writing this weekly story.

## 3. Celebration

Each week you'll have three top personal and professional goals.

Write out your progress for each of these goals. You might not have achieved all of your goals, but you can celebrate the progress you've made.

## 4. Rate your week

Rate your week on a scale of 1 to 10. 1 being a mediocre week and 10 being the best week ever.

Write out some motivation for this rating. Try to be specific and honest so you can learn from your week and find patterns that make you successful.

## 5. Truly exceptionals

Set your truly exceptional goals for your personal and professional life.

What 3 things must happen over the next 7 days for me to feel this week was very successful

## 6. Prioritization

In this step we'll think about the best practices in the important areas of your life. 

For example: personal life. Ask yourself "When I'm at my best personally, what are the activities that I'm doing?" Reading, exercise, meditation, etc.

We'll have inventories for each area with best practices. Review them and maybe add to them as well. The reflection we did so far will help you find patterns and best practices.

Now we select the best practices we want to focus on for the next week for each area (max 10).

## 7. Schedule

Look at your prioritizations and weekly goals and schedule activities in time blocks for each day.

## 8. Live it

Wake up each day, look at your schedule and live by it. What is scheduled gets done.

Instead of living a reactive life, you'll live a proactive and balanced life.
